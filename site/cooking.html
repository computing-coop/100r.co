<q>The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of diseases. <br>— Thomas Edison, 1903</q>
<p>Cooking is another creative outlet, not unlike drawing or writing. We find joy in it. It's an activity that we can do together which we believe is essential for well-being.</p>

<h2 id='galley'><a href='galley.html'>galley</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/galley_stove.jpg' /loading='lazy'>
<p>Our galley is small, but has enough room for two people to cook. We have a 3-burner gimballed stove, equipped with a large oven. Since Pino has no <a href='refrigeration.html' class='local'>refrigeration</a>, we go out shopping for fresh food almost everyday.</p>

<p>We use our old ice box as a space for bulk containers of liquids, like big 5 L (1.3 US gal) bottles of olive oil, soy sauce, roasted sesame oil, apple cider vinegar, white vinegar etc.</p>

<h2 id='galley_tools'><a href='galley_tools.html'>galley tools</a></h2><p>As with most things in life, 20% of anything does 80% of the work. When moving into a smaller space, it is important to find that 20% and surround yourself with things purposefully. Single-serving tools and kitchenware will not do.</p>

<p>We choose durable(stainless steel, quality wood), multi-functional and simple (unibody, non-electric) <a href='https://grimgrains.com/#tools' target='_blank' class='external'>tools</a>.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/essentials.jpg' />
<p>Ideal materials include glass, wood, cast iron and stainless steel. For cooking, we have:

<h2 id='diet'><a href='diet.html'>diet</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/cooking.2.jpg' loading='lazy' />
<q>People are fed by the food industry, which pays no attention to health, and are treated by the health industry, which pays no attention to food. — Wendell Berry</q>
<p>Our diet consists solely of plants (legumes, fruits, grains, seeds, vegetables etc). The content of our meals depend on the season and our location. We look at the adaptation and adoption of local produce as an exercise in creativity. Most processed food will come thickly packaged, and so to limit our waste we tend to avoid them.</p>
<p>Below is a list of rules that we go by, when it comes to choosing what to eat:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Eat varied foods. Biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields.</li>
    <li>2. Pay more. Spend more for foods grown or raised less intensively and with more care.</li>
    <li>3. Eat mostly plants. Especially leafy greens.</li>
	<li>4. Cook. Instead of eating out. If you can, plant a garden.</li>
    <li>5. Avoid processed foods.</li>
    <li>6. Eat local seasonal ingredients. It's cheaper, and supports the local community.</li>
</ul>
<p>We eat a plant-based diet for <a href='https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Should_we_go_vegan%3F' target='_blank' class='external'>health, ethical and environmental reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Appropriately planned plant-based diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.</p>

<h2 id='nutrition'><a href='nutrition.html'>nutrition</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/lemons.jpg' title='lemons, a rich source of vitamin C' loading='lazy'>

<p>Following a <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/nutrition.html' target='_blank' class='external'>plant-based diet</a> while traveling is possible. Planning provisions ahead is important, a lot of the places may not have specialty items. Nutritional yeast, miso, dried legumes, quality wholegrain flour, flax seeds and B12 supplements, are especially hard to find.</p>
<p>Buying a large supply of shelf-stable tofu is always a good idea; it's a product that is high in protein and that can be used to make sauces and sautees, while providing calcium (makes sure it has calcium sulfate or calcium chloride in the ingredients list). For iodine, carry iodized salt, or seaweed (wakame or nori). Other essentials, like omega 6 (LA, linoleic acid), can be found in pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds for instance, omega 3 (ALA, alpha-linoleic acid) can be found in linseed, soy beans, chia seeds etc.</p>
<p>Staples like nut milks and oats are found everywhere, varying in price and quality. It is sometimes difficult to find nut milk without added sugar or flavorings. There will always be fresh vegetables available, but the selection can be poor at times. Carrying a dried version of those foods can help, for example: dried mushrooms, radish, seaweed, tomatoes etc. Drying your own fresh is even better, it is a good way to keep fruits while on long passages, but only possible in places with a lot of sun and not too much humidity.</p>
<p>Eating frozen produce can help in a bind. A lot of frozen vegetables don't lose their nutrients, like broccoli for instance. Most places will carry frozen goods, and it's generally cheaper than buying the same item fresh. If like us  you lack a fridge, get a bag with insulation or a cooler and keep it in there with other frozen goods. It won't keep forever, but it helps to slow the thawing process.</p>
<p><a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/nutrition.html' target='_blank'>Read more</a> about plant based nutrition.</p>

<h2 id='refrigeration'><a href='refrigeration.html'>refrigeration</a></h2><p>Refrigeration is a modern convenience we choose to do without, we prefer to limit the use of energy-guzzling devices and to educate ourselves on proper storage of ingredients.</p>

<p>General tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Buy veg and fruit without bruises (they last longer)</li>
	<li>Mist summer veg and fruit with water on occasion.</li>
	<li>Wax the stems of aubergines, grapes and melons.</li>
	<li>Buy never-refrigerated veggies.</li>
	<li>Eat items with shorter shelf life first.</li>
	<li>Buy in season produce.</li>
	<li>Separate foods that release ethylene from those sensitive to it.</li>
	<li>Never wash berries until just before use.</li>
</ul>

<p>We look at our inventory of fresh foods daily, and eat items with a shorter shelf life first, like fresh herbs and greens. Then, we move on to tomatoes, eggplants, and onto carrots and beets. In the end, we're usually left with onions, garlic, cabbage, potatoes and pumpkins. Potatoes and onions will last months if kept in a dark dry place, and some fruit will last a while if wrapped in towels, foil or newspapers. To read more about keeping fresh produce without a fridge, read the article <a href='https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Garde-Manger/en' target='_blank'>Food Storage Beyond the Refrigerator</a> by Low Tech Labs, they go in-depth on how to store everything. We use this as a reference for storing our produce.</p>

<p>Most condiments like vinegar, soy sauce, mustard and peanut butter do well in cupboards. Molasses, maple syrup and jam will also keep for many weeks.</p>

<p>Relying on the selection of local and seasonal produce from farmer's markets makes us discover new ingredients, while it encourages local vendors, and cuts down on emissions from transport. Alternatively, making preserves and pickles (see <a href='lactofermentation.html' class='local'>lactofermentation</a>) allows us to enjoy some foods out of their season. In <a href='new_zealand.html' class='local'>new zealand</a>, a friend once gave us feijoas that we processed into chutney which we had the following year.</p>

<p>We eat leftovers the next day, incorporating them into other meals to offer some variety. Preparing food in the pressure cooker, and letting it rest unopened will help preserve the food. If left overnight, it can be reheated in the morning and will keep well until lunchtime.</p>

<h2 id='washing_produce'><a href='washing_produce.html'>washing produce</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/washing.jpg' />
<p>After buying fresh produce at the market we wash everything in a bucket using a water and baking soda solution. If there's a lot of dirt, we scrub them with a brush. The mechanical rubbing action and rinsing is very good at removing contaminants. Then finally, we rinse them off with fresh running water running our pressure sprayer (to conserve water, pictured above) and let them dry in the sun. They need to be completely dry, otherwise they may rot faster (moisture accelerates rot).</p>
<p>Washing produce in baking soda prevents foodborne illness and substantially reduces exposure to pesticides, it is more effective than using a vinegar solution (because it needs to be used full-strength, and that can get expensive). This washing technique is the same for fresh greens and fruits, although for berries it is best to wash them right before eating them.</p>
<h2 id='saving_fuel'><a href='saving_fuel.html'>saving_fuel</a></h2><p>When at sea on a long passage between continents, far from everyone and everything, we  manage resources onboard with care. Being frugal with water, food and energy ensures that there is enough for the duration of the trip. When cooking, we monitor our fuel usage and use several techniques to require less. Cooking fuel may be easy to get when near shore, but the tanks of spaceship earth are not infinite. We can all benefit from adopting energy-saving cooking techniques. It saves money, while extending its use.</p>

<p>Aboard Pino we use LPG, but have experience with both alcohol and induction heat cookers. Over the years we’ve experimented with ways to use less energy. The following advice is also relevant to those using electricity for cooking.</p>

<p><b>General energy-saving tips:</b></p>

<p>When cooking, the heat from the stove is transferred to the pot, and most types of cookstoves suffer energy losses. Higher efficiency can be achieved by minimizing the loss of heat to the surroundings, and by ensuring that there is a maximum transfer of heat from the source of heat to the pot.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Use a lid.</b> You will stop steam from escaping the pot, the steam is energy lost to the cooking process.</li>
  <li><b>Use a pot skirt.</b> A simple ring around the base of the pot, will help to preserve and concentrate heat.</li>
  <li><b>Focus on the task.</b> Obvious, but when distracted we use up more energy. Concentrate on the task, pay attention to cooking times so as to not overcook the food.</li>
  <li><b>Use less water.</b> The less water used, the less energy is required to heat up the meal. On a boat with limited tankage, using less is better anyway.</li>
  <li><b>Reduce intensity after boiling.</b> After boiling point is reached, lower to a simmer or transfer to an insulated cooker (see below).  Shorter cooking times also prevent nutrient-loss.</li>
  <li><b>Cut food small.</b> Chinese cooks use this technique, they cut vegetables small so they cook fast in a stir-fry. Smaller cuts have more contact area and will soften quicker, take up more flavor and use less energy.</li>
  <li><b>Pre-soak dry food.</b> Legumes, grains and other kinds of dried food will cook faster when pre-soaked, don’t skip that step. We like to soak steel cut oats before bed, then it takes just 5-10 minutes to cook, rather than 20-30 minutes. The shorter time results in chewier oats (our personal preference).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='pressure_cooker'><a href='pressure_cooker.html'>pressure_cooker</a></h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/pressurecooker.jpg' load='lazy'/>

<p>Foods that require 60 minutes on the stovetop will take 10-15 minutes in a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers are airtight containers, designed to allow pressure to build-up beyond atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>We cook entire meals at once, for example we’ll place ingredients for chili in the bottom of the pot, with a trivet overtop with a covered bowl of rice and water. The whole meal is ready in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Pressure cookers are generally quite big, and double as a big pot(we use ours to boil corn).</p> 

<h2 id='insulation_cooking'><a href='insulation_cooking.html'>insulation_cooking</a></h2>
<img src='../media/content/cooking/haybox4.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>There are insulation cookers on the market, but it is possible to make one for cheap by using thick blankets or a sleeping bag. To make a quick insulated space, use a plastic bin, or wooden crate, and fill it with thick blankets or a sleeping bag, leaving a deep well in the center. Insert the pot in the well and cover with more blankets. The pot will stay warm for hours.
</p>

<p>We have cooked <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_blackberry_cake.html' target='_blank'>stovetop cakes</a> using this method .</p>

<img src='../media/content/cooking/haybox5.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>It’s also possible to cook rice in a thermos, by simply pouring hot water over it and leaving it to slow cook.</p>
<h2 id='induction_cooking'><a href='induction_cooking.html'>induction_cooking</a></h2><p>Induction cooktops are becoming more common on boats. It creates heat rapidly by magnetically accelerating metal molecules in steel, cast-iron and some stainless steel pots. It transfers 90% of its heat to a pot. They use heat efficiently and because they heat the pot material there is less heat loss. Nearly all of the energy is converted into cooking the food. A downside of IH is the high-power draw, which ranges between 1200-1800W for a single plate.</p>

<p>We used a single IH cooktop while in Japan, since it was difficult to refill an <a href='lpg.html' class='local'>lpg</a> tank. We enjoyed the experience, but we were connected to shore power at the time and would never think to use it while at anchor. Using an IH cooker off the grid is possible, but requires a large battery bank, a larger inverter, and more solar and/or a generator. Smaller boats like ours do not have a large battery bank, or infinite surface for solar. In any case, IH cookers are more energy efficient than conventional electric cookers.</p>
<h2 id='sun_driers'><a href='sun_driers.html'>sun_driers</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/raisins.jpg' title='dried coronation grapes, raisins.' loading='lazy' />

<p>Dehydrating fresh foods when they are in season is another way to save energy, it also reduces the volume of food, saving precious space and weight on board. Drying food with the sun on a boat is more efficient in warm places.</p>

<p>When drying food, pick quality produce, and wash items well.  This website has good information.  Pre-treating certain fruits(apples, apricots, peaches, and pears) with ascorbic acid(2 ½ tbsp:1 quart water), citric acid(1 tsp:1 quart cold water) or lemon juice(1:1 cold water) will help preserve their nutrients and color. Soak for 10 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon, drain and proceed to dehydrate. </p>

<p>There are solar driers on the market, but building one is inexpensive, and requires few parts. It consists of layering shelves made with screens (to allow air to pass all around), and covering it with a net to protect from insects. When insects aren’t an issue, another solution is to string the pieces of food with a strong thread and to hang them in the sun (may not work well on windy days). In <a href='japan.html' class='local'>japan</a>, this is the technique used to dry entire hachiya persimmons, but the process for an entire fruit is longer, and can take eight weeks of drying and massaging, maybe not a good idea for a cruising yacht. Cutting fruit into small pieces will hasten drying. The higher the water content, the larger the slice size should be.</p>

<p>We experimented with drying bananas and vegetables on deck while in <a href='fiji.html' class='local'>fiji</a>, using a wide metal bowl we had onboard. It worked well enough, but we had to flip the pieces often to dry them well on both sides. This technique is not as efficient as a suspended drier, but it works well for small quantities. We would take the bowl in at night if the drying process wasn’t complete, and put it back on deck come morning. </p>

<p>Check that each piece is dried uniformly, and pack them in airtight containers. For long-term, it is a good idea to vacuum seal them, or to add packets of food-safe dessicants. Properly stored, dried fruits keep well for six to 12 months. The reconstituted food retains most nutrients. We like to add them to pasta or rice water while cooking.</p>
<h2 id='lactofermentation'><a href='lactofermentation.html'>lactofermentation</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/lacto.jpg' title='indian style pickled carrots' loading='lazy' />

<p>We preserve food whenever possible. Preserving food by lacto-fermentation keeps vitamins intact, and in some vegetables, increases its nutritional value. Fermentation also improves the immune system, and digestibility of the food, making them easier for our systems to assimilate.</p>

<q>You don’t need to be an expert to preserve food, or any fancy technology. Just a container, some salt, and trust in the world of bacteria and fungi.<br> — A. Vansintjan, 2017.</q>

<p>Lacto-fermentation is easy to do, requiring only fresh vegetables, salt, water and air-tight containers. All vegetables can be fermented. Microbial activity occurs which secrete lactic acid, co2 and a variety of enzymes. Lactic acid inhibits the growth of bad bacteria. The mixture eventually achieves a state of balance, and fermentation stops. Conserving vegetables this way can last many years, even when stored at room temperature.</p>

<p>Lacto-fermentation is very safe, the PH of the mixture is so low (below 5) that no pathogens can survive. If ever a fermentation goes wrong, you'll smell it, and it'll be easy to spot, this makes accidentally eating a bad lacto-fermented product very difficult.</p>

<p>We make sauerkraut, kimchi and other pickled vegetables (carrots, beet root, garlic etc). We use the dry-salt method. The dry-salting method requires that vegetables be chopped or shredded, for only with lots of surface area exposed can the salt pull water out of the vegetables.</p>

<img src='../media/content/cooking/lacto2.jpg' title='white cauliflower and red onions' loading='lazy' />

<p>We recommended 45 g (3 tbsp) of salt (we use pickling salt, not iodized) per 2.3 kg (5 lbs) of vegetables. Salt essentially slows fermentation and enzyme activity and thereby prolongs preservation potential. Temperature also impacts upon the speed of fermentation (fermentation occurs faster in summer than winter). If we preserve vegetables with the goal of eating them much later, we add more salt, if the goal is to eat it as soon as it's ready, we use less.</p>

<p>Our favorite jar type is the spring-top variety with the rubber seal. If under pressure, the jar will 'burp' itself without letting air inside. We don't yet know if the metal spring will last at sea, but we're willing to try.</p>

<p>To start doing lacto-fermentation, we recommend this great <a href='https://revolutionfermentation.com/en/blogs/fermented-vegetables/napa-vegan-kimchi-recipe/#recipe' target='_blank'>kimchi recipe</a> by Tout cru! Fermentation. Like the author of this recipe we usually just eat it after 2-3 days, but add kombu powder and use chili flakes instead of gochugaru.</p>

<p>For more about fermentation, we recommend the book <b>The Art of Fermentation</b> by Sandor Ellix Katz, and the blog <a href='https://nicrunicuit.com/mentions-legales/' target="_blank">Nicrunicuit(french)</a> by Marie-Claire Frédéric. Remember, "fermentation is just controlled decay: your most important ingredient is time".</p>

<h3>What to do when a jar is opened</h3>

<p>Once we open a jar we go through them fast, usually within a week, but they can last for months. It is necessary to take a few precautions though...</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Use clean tools.</b> Don't use a fork that's been in your mouth, and don't handle veg in the jar with your fingers</li>
<li><b>Weigh veg down if in brine.</b> Keeping everything submerged in the liquid will ensure they last. If too little remains in the jar but you're not ready to eat them, transfer to a smaller, clean jar.</li>
<li><b>Close jar between servings.</b> Don't leave it open unnecessarily.</li>
<li><b>Store in a cool area.</b> When opened, store in an area under 15 C.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Growing food aboard is possible. Keeping soil aboard is not practical for a small vessel, but sprouting is a good alternative. Sprouting seeds is a good way to transform dried foods into fresh foods, sprouting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouting#Nutrition' target='_blank'>reduces anti-nutritional compounds</a> in raw legumes making more of their nutrients available. Microgreens are germinated legumes grown up to 10cm, microgreens contain considerably higher levels of vitamins and carotenoids, about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgreen#Nutritional_analysis' target='_blank'>five times greater</a> than their mature plant counterparts.</p>

<p>Sprouting offers a constant, and reliable supply of fresh and healthful food. Dry seeds last a long time, and take up little space. Sprouting is also a good way to cut down on cooking time, thus saving fuel.</p>

<p>On the boat, we sprout lentils, radish and fenugreek. To learn more about growing food aboard a sailboat, we recommend reading Ken Neumeyer's <a href='https://we.riseup.net/assets/268677/sailfarm.pdf' target='_blank'>Sailing The Farm</a>, and this <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">Sprouting Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Sprouting lentils</h3>

<img src='../media/content/cooking/vertical.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<ul>
    <li>Soak 1/3 cup of lentils overnight.</li>
    <li>Move into an upside-down jar covered with a mesh to drain water.</li>
    <li>Rinse every morning, enjoy fresh greens daily.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regrowing foods</h3>

<p>Some vegetables can regrow from cuttings, like leek, cabbage, green onions, chives etc. Although we don't keep them in soil anymore, they'll re-grow if kept in water. You only need enough water to cover the roots.</p>

<h3>Microgreens</h3>

<p>We experimented with growing microgreens. As always, lentils perform best over other seeds.</p>

<h2 id='food_grinder'><a href='food_grinder.html'>food grinder</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/soy1.jpg'/>

<p>We have an old fashioned food processor (meat grinder) on board. They're easy to find in thrift stores, and generally cost anywhere from 10-15$. It has quickly become one of our favorite <a href='galley_tools.html' class='local'>galley tools</a>.</p>

<p>We first decided to get one to process peanuts into peanut butter, and to process wheat berries into a mush to bake bread.</p>

<p>We have since found that it works well to grind soybeans to make soy milk. They are easy to take apart and clean, but the metal discs should be coated with vegetable oil after every use, otherwise they will rust.</p>

<img src='../media/content/cooking/soy4.jpg'/>

<p>We also like to use a simple potato masher to make hummus, cooked beans are easy to squish by hand.</p>


<h2 id='food_storage'><a href='food_storage.html'>food storage</a></h2><p>We like to use glass to store food, especially big glass carboys. Plastic bins designed for drinking <a href='water.html' class='local'>water</a> are also good to store large quantities of grains and other dried goods, like legumes and rice. Food-grade plastics are identified by the recycling number on the bottom. 1, 2, 4 and 5 are food-grade, but also to check to see if they are “food-safe”. Food-grade plastics are very stable and won’t degrade in sunlight, but they may have been treated with a dye that compromises the bucket and could leach into your stored food or water.</p>

<img src='../media/content/cooking/soy0.jpg'/>

<p>We also carry 4 L jars for other items, as well as 1 L ones. We also use 1 gallons carboys to store grains.</p>

<p>Foods that might attract weevils include: flours, cereal, rice, quinoa, pasta, oats, barley, corn and wheat berries. Store in air-tight glass or thick-walled containers so that if there is an infestation in one jar, the insects won't be able to escape to contaminate other containers. See our notes on <a href='provisioning.html' class='local'>provisioning</a>.</p>


<h2 id='coffee'><a href='coffee.html'>coffee</a></h2><img src='../media/content/cooking/coffee.jpg' / loading='lazy'>

<p>Aboard Pino, we grind our coffee by hand using a little grinder with ceramic burrs. Then, we brew the ground using our 6-cup stovetop mokapot (rescued in the trash) and dilute the coffee with water (as it's very strong expresso).</p>

<p>We use our french press when there are guests, otherwise it takes forever to brew enough cups for a large group. We like to buy our beans in large 2 kg (5 lbs) bags. We also stock jars of instant coffee.</p>

<h3>Instant coffee as a wood stain</h3>

<p>When diluted in water, instant coffee makes a good stain for wood. We like it because it smells good and because we always have plenty around!</p>

<p>For a dark brown, use less water (1:1), for a lighter tone, dilute with more and re-coat until happy with the tint. For a dark coat, we like to add two layers with a paintbrush and let it dry in the sun. See the base for our <a href='woodstove_installation.html' class='local'>woodstove installation</a>, and the box for our <a href='dry_toilet.html' class='local'>dry toilet</a> for an example of this type of staining.</p>
