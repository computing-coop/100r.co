<p>Our main water tank carries 170 L (45 US gal), our secondary has 50 L (13 US gal), while an additional 100 L (26 US gal) is stored in jerry cans.</p>

<p>When it is not possible to dock at a marina, we use smaller(4x10L|4x2.6 US gallons) jerry cans to ferry water from shore. While it requires more trips, the lighter containers are less prone to breakage.</p>

<p>Pino has no watermaker, and doesn't want one, much preferring to catch {rain} instead.</p>
