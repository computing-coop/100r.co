<p>When {anchoring}, it can be difficult to stay focused. The {weather} decides everything. It determines whether or not we can work. If the weather is foul, we are on anchor-watch to make sure we don't drag.</p>
<p>Waves also make it hard to do simple tasks like writing, or drawing. Depending on the direction of the wind, we need to move the boat and that too, takes focus and time away from work. Calm and sunny days are distracting in other ways: when the water is clear and teeming with colourful fish, it is difficult to resist jumping off. All in all though, we welcome these interruptions, as it ensures we take enough work breaks.</p>
