<p>Launch the app. You'll see a <b>main window</b>, as well as a <b>sidebar</b> on the left. You'll be writing in the main window, the sidebar will list all of the <b>markers</b> and <b>separate files</b> that you create.</p>
<p>The app opens with a <b>splash</b>, listing a guide as well as a list of shortcuts. At the bottom left of the main window, there are numbers followed by letters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>L stands for lines</li>
    <li>W for words</li>
    <li>V for vocabulary</li>
    <li>C for character.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write, these numbers will increase and you'll know exactly how many lines, words, characters and unique words there are in your text. These stats are followed by a <b>percentage</b> to show you where you are in the text, with 0% indicating the beginning, and 100% the end - this is useful when writing large texts.</p>
