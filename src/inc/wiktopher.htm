<p><a href='https://wiktopher.ca' target='_blank' class='external'>Wiktopher</a> is an eco-fiction story published online. The story follows two characters, Lupin and Eka, as they navigate the barren lands of the Soronan Desert, seeking food, company and supplies while living day-to-day.</p>

<p>Rekka began writing this story while in Tahihi, {French Polynesia}. Because of laptop problems (see {tools ecosystem}), drawing using heavy software like Photoshop was near impossible, and so we were forced to consider other hobbies. Rekka got back into writing, and created Wiktopher, inspired from our own travels and discoveries. {Left} was created during this time, to make the writing of this story possible.</p>

<p>Wiktopher is gender neutral as an experiment in creativity, but also to discourage readers from judging characters based on their genders.</p>

<p>It is still in production. We hope to publish a physical copy (which would include a fauna/flora encyclopedia), and to release it as an audio book too.</p>

<p>The story is available to <a href='https://wiktopher.ca' target='_blank' class='external'>read online</a>, and is updated on a monthly basis.</p>
