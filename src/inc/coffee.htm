<p>Aboard Pino, we grind our coffee by hand using a little grinder with ceramic burrs. Then, we brew the ground using our 6-cup stovetop mokapot (rescued in the trash) and dilute the coffee with water (as it's very strong expresso).</p>

<p>We use our french press when there are guests, otherwise it takes forever to brew enough cups for a large group. We like to buy our beans in large 2 kg (5 lbs) bags. We also stock jars of instant coffee.</p>

<h3>Instant coffee as a wood stain</h3>

<p>When diluted in water, instant coffee makes a good stain for wood. We like it because it smells good and because we always have plenty around!</p>

<p>For a dark brown, use less water (1:1), for a lighter tone, dilute with more and re-coat until happy with the tint. For a dark coat, we like to add two layers with a paintbrush and let it dry in the sun. See the base for our {woodstove installation}, and the box for our {dry toilet} for an example of this type of staining.</p>
