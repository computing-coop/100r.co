<p>When living on the water, your home is always in motion, swaying with the currents and winds. Knowing that your vessel is not permanently tethered to the earth is a good feeling. It means you can go anywhere.</p>

<p>Our primary mode of transport has always been our {bikes}, they're quiet, and we're free to move myself around wherever, and whenever we want. Traveling by sailboat is taking this a step further. You can move yourself over from one continent to the other.</p>

<p>If you want to live in a sailboat you don't have to sail {offshore}. There is much to experience and see while staying in one country, and if ever you have the itch to leave you can do it. There are many benefits to having a floating home (see our {buying a sailboat} guide).</p>
