<p>Turnip is a Honda 2.3 HP outboard motor, a 4-stroke air-cooled model. We bought it in San Diego in October 2016. When paired with {Iggy}, it carried us safely from ship to shore.</p>

<p>At the start of our jump from {Mexico} to {French Polynesia} in 2017, we added angry eyes and eyebrows to its hood. We like how Turnip appeared to be constantly displeased with us from afar.</p>

<p>On April 10th 2021, Turnip was passed down to another owner. We have plans to get a rowing dinghy, and will not need a powered engine anymore.</p>
