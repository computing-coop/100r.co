<p>In early 2021, we bought and installed the 'laptop' of cookstoves, a cast iron <a href='http://www.marinestove.com/sardineinfo.htm' target='_blank'>Sardine woodstove</a> by Navigator Stoveworks. This stove is designed specifically for boats, its stove pattern sets have their roots in Nova Scotia, Canada. Starting in 1891, the Lunenburg Foundry produced marine equipment for yachts and commercial vessels. They ceased production in the early 1990's, and Navigator Stoveworks utilized their foundry patterns and continued to produce them. We are glad they did, as they are wonderful little stoves.</p>

<p>The Sardine is 30x30x28 cm (12 x 12 x 11 in), and weighs 16 kg (35 Lbs). It outputs 7,500-18,000 BTUs [ 2-5 Kw.]</p>
