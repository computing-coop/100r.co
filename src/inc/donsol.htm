<p>Donsol, short for <b>Dungeon Solitaire</b> was designed by John Eternal, during <a href='http://trainjam.com/' class='external' target='_blank'>train jam</a> in 2015, it was later made into an iOS game with Devine. It was released in April 2015 on the app store. The game was in turn ported to all desktop platforms.</p>

<p>In 2018, we removed the game from the iOS store, in a conscious attempt to distance ourselves from the Apple ecosystem. After looking at the trajectory of the development tools, namely the bloated development environment, we did not believe that it was possible for us to continue working on our games, while at sea with little connectivity for the Apple mobile platform.</p>

<p>We also could not reconcile pushing for environmentally conscious action, while supporting a company that fights against the <a href='https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro' target='_blank' class='external'>Right to Repair</a>, and create <a href='https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/neaz3d/airpods-are-a-tragedy' target='_blank' class='external'>wasteful products</a>. Instead, the game was published exclusively on the <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/oquonie' target='_blank' class='external'>Itch.io store</a>, a publishing platform in line with our values.</p>

<p>More recently, Donsol was re-released as a famicom game, sold as a digital ROM and playable with an emulator. The iOS version of the game is no longer sold/supported.</p>

<p>Why <a href='https://www.patreon.com/posts/round-up-of-2019-32923541' target='_blank'>Assembly</a>? Because we want to produce lasting versions of our games, to use simpler tools, to make more resilient software with fewer dependencies, and to support older hardware as to give a second life to old electronics.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/donsol' target='_blank'>Donsol ROM download</a> comes with an instruction booklet, which includes new art.</p>

<h2 id='how_to_play'>how to play</h2>

<p>A <b>standard deck of 54 cards</b>, jokers included, is a dungeon. Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards, display them before you, this is a room. A room ends when all the cards are folded.</p>
<p><b>♥︎ Heart Potions</b></p>
<p>A <b>potion</b> gives you health points equal to its value, up to a maximum of 21 health points.</p>
<p>Drinking multiple potions in a row will make you sick and result in no extra healing, only the first potion's value will be gained in HP. Potions are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.</p>
<p><b>♦ Diamond Shields</b></p>
<p>A <b>shield</b> absorbs the damage difference between the shield value and that of the attacked monster's value.</p>
<p>Shields can only defend against monsters in descending value and if you use a shield on a monster with higher or equal value to the previous, it will break. Broken shields leave you unarmored, and you take full damage. Folding shield card will always replace a previously equipped shield. Shields are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.</p>
