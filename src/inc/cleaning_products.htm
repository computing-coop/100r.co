<p>When it comes to cleaning, polishing or abrading, you don't need a crazy arsenal of products. Below is a list of recommendations for household cleaning, or {maintenance} aboard a boat.</p>
<table class='col' border='1'>
    <tr>
        <td><b>All purpose cleaner</b></td>
        <td>Mix of 500 ml hydrogen peroxide(3%) with 2.5 ml(40 drops) of lavender and lemon essential oils, and 0.6 ml(10 drops) of peppermint essential oil. Leave on surface for several minutes before wiping clean. Store in a dark-coloured bottle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Chrome</b></td>
        <td>Apply apple cider vinegar on a soft cotton cloth to rub it clean. Then, use a fresh cloth with a dab of baby oil to make it shine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Copper</b></td>
        <td>Make a paste of either lemon or lime juice and salt. Rub gently to clean.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Aluminum</b></td>
        <td>Cream of tartar and hot water. In a dish, add a few spoonfuls of cream of tartar, and stir in water to create a thick paste. Rub over the aluminum surface with a soft cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Acrylic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mild dish soap. Mix about 1 L of water with a few drops of dish soap in a bowl, agitate to create suds. Dip cloth into mix, clean acrylic gently. Wipe with a clean, damp rag, and follow up with a soft, dry rag to collect leftover moisture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Plastic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mixture of 1:2 white vinegar and warm water.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Brass</b></td>
        <td>Coat the cut half of the lemon with table salt and rub it over the surface, re-coating the lemon with salt as needed. Buff to a shine with a clean, dry cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Cast iron</b></td>
        <td>Immediately after use, clean with plain hot water and a sponge. Stuck on food can be removed with a paste made of coarse salt and water. Dry with a towel, or over the oven at a low flame, and coat with a layer of oil.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Stainless steel</b></td>
        <td>Wipe down with freshwater, or use a mild soap solution and warm water for tough stains.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Fibreglass</b></td>
        <td>Dislodge debris with a scrubbing brush, rinse off with fresh water. For rust stains, make a paste of baking soda and water. Use a soft cloth and gently rub mixture onto the stain. Leave for 1 hour. For heavy yellow waterline and rust stains try Grunt emer-gel, a phosphoric acid-based product. Wear gloves while using it, as it is an irritant.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood dishes</b></td>
        <td>Wash with mild soap and warm water. Dry immediately after washing. Never soak in water or put it away wet. Every month, apply a coat of food-grade oil (we use coconut) to keep the wood moisturized.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood cutting boards</b></td>
        <td>Same basic treatment as wood dishes. Before adding oil, scrub clean with lemon and salt. Sprinkle board with coarse salt. Using a lemon half, cut side down, scour the surface. Let sit for 5 minutes, scrape mixture away, rinse clean and let air dry.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Sails</b></td>
        <td>Wash with cool water mixed with dishwashing liquid. Let dry thoroughly before storing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Mildew</b></td>
        <td>Use white vinegar or lemon juice full strength. Apply with a sponge or scrubby.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Head</b></td>
        <td>Sprinkle baking soda into the bowl, scrub with a brush.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Sink clog</b></td>
        <td>Pour 120 ml or more of baking soda down the drain, then add 250 ml of vinegar. Plug it up, and let it sit 10-15 min, then pour more hot water down. Repeat until clear.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Clothes</b></td>
        <td>Mix 2 cups of washing soda with the gratings from one 140 g bar of castile soap. Use 15 g for light loads, and 30 g for heavy loads. To whiten, disinfect, deodorize clothes of dish cloths, use sodium percarbonate at a ratio of 15 g per 5 L.</td>
