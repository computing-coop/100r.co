<p>We have replaced our old aluminum jib cars, which had developed cracks around the pivot, with a simple dyneema loop around a <a href='https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f116/dyneema-loops-blocks-as-an-alternative-to-a-jib-car-146801.html' target='_blank'>frictionless sailing ring</a>. We liked the simplicity of that system more than the traditional blocks.</p>

<h3>Braid</h3>

<p>We followed <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-4AYV7jKRA' target='_blank'>this tutorial</a> on how to braid the loop of dyneema. We made a fid(a hollow spike for use in ropework) from an old knitting needle. We have secured the loop around the sailing ring and on itself, with a few stitches of waxed thread.</p>
