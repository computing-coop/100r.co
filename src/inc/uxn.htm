<p>Uxn is a portable 8-bit <a href='https://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons/' target='_blank'>virtual computer</a> capable of running the handful of tools we use, on our various low-power and classic hardware. It can be used as a playground to learn basic computation skills.</p>

<p>We've already ported {Orca}, {Nasu}, {Left} and <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/noodle/'>noodle</a> to uxn-compatible ROMs. Each one is written in a <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html' target='_blank'>special flavor of assembly</a> designed specifically for the Uxn computer. To learn more, see the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html' target='_blank'>technical documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Why create a smol virtual computer?</h3>

<img src='../media/content/uxn/left.jpg' title='The Left text editor on Uxn' loading='lazy' />

<p>We want to produce lasting versions of our tools and games, and by using simpler systems(the UxnVM is <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/master/item/src/uxn.c' target='_blank'>about 200 lines of C</a>) we can build more resilient software due to their lack of dependencies, and support older hardware when possible. The Uxn emulator is extremely simple, and can be ported to an unsupported system <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/106785824688368264'>quickly</a>. Try Uxn on <a href='https://github.com/asiekierka/uxnds'>NintendoDS</a>, <a href='https://git.badd10de.dev/uxngba'>Gameboy Advance</a>, <a href='https://merveilles.town/@alderwick/106222101764116637' target='_blank'>Rasperry Pi Pico</a> or on <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/'>desktop</a>.</p>

<p>As it stands today, modern software is built with extreme short-sightedness, designed to be run on disposable electronics and near impossible to maintain, so we decided to not participate in this race to the bottom. Our aim is to create a machine that focuses on answering the handful of tasks we need, which is centered around building playful audio/visual experiences.</p>

<p>To borrow the words of Viznut Heikkil√§ on <a href='http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html' target='_blank'>permacomputing</a>, we're interested in cultural and ecological permanence. "That is, how to give computers a meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere".</p>

<p>Uxn is currently under development, we use #uxn on irc.esper.net to coordinate development [07-05-21].</p>
