<p>The Beaufort Scale of Wind Force was developed in 1805 by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort as a means for sailors to gauge wind speeds through visual observations of the sea state.</p>

<p>The scale runs from Force 0 (calm) to Force 12 (Hurricane).</p>

    <td>Fresh Breeze</td>
    <td>Moderate waves 4-8 ft taking longer form, many whitecaps, some spray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>22-27</td>
    <td>Strong Breeze</td>
    <td>Larger waves 8-13 ft, whitecaps common, more spray.</td>

<tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>34-40</td>
    <td>Gale</td>
    <td>Moderately high (13-20 ft) waves of greater length, edges of crests begin to break into spindrift, foam blown in streaks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>41-47</td>
    <td>Strong Gale</td>
    <td>High waves (20 ft), sea begins to roll, dense streaks of foam, spray may reduce visibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>48-55</td>
    <td>Storm</td>
    <td>Very high waves (20-30 ft) with overhanging crests, sea white with densely blown foam, heavy rolling, lowered visibility.</td>

    <td>11</td>
    <td>56-63</td>
    <td>Violent Storm</td>
    <td>Exceptionally high (30-45 ft) waves, foam patches cover sea, visibility more reduced.</td>

    <td>12</td>
    <td>64+</td>
    <td>Hurricane</td>
    <td>Air filled with foam, waves over 45 ft, sea completely white with driving spray, visibility greatly reduced.</td>
