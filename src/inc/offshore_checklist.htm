<p>Offshore checklist sourced from <a href='https://www.vicmaui.org/' target='_blank'>Vic Maui</a> and <a href='https://astrolabesailing.com/2014/03/24/yachting-nz-cat-1/' target='_blank'>Yachting NZ Cat 1</a>.</p>

<h2><a id='experience'>Our experience</a></h2>

<p>We used this checklist to prepare Pino for our departure from Canada in 2016. We did our best to fulfill most of these requirements, as they were put in place to keep people safe. We left with a roller-furler without a storm jib, but in hindsight, we should have had one. We reduced the jib in heavy weather, but a dedicated sail would have been better. A heavy storm jib is also useful for self-steering using the poled storm jib method.</p>

<p>While in the {north pacific ocean}, our boat was knocked down, and we had not adequately attached some of the floorboards. It did not cause any damage inside but it could have. In the future we will secure these properly. We also did not strap down the engine, relying entirely on the engine mounts.</p>

<p>Neither of us had first-aid training, relying entirely on books and lived experiences. If you're able to get training, do it.</p>

<p>We did not have an EPIRB, but if you can afford one, get it. We had a registered PLB instead, which is not ideal, but better than nothing.</p>
