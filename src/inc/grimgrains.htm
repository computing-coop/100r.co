<p>Grimgrains is our <a href='http://grimgrains.com' target='_blank' class='external'>cooking blog</a>. It showcases our favourite creations, along with hand-drawn illustrations for each ingredient.</p>

<p>We started Grimgrains to teach ourselves how to cook. This blog—which now doubles as a travel diary—helps measure our progress. It's also a way to share what we've learned.</p>
