<p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5KG CO2 tank</li>
    <li>A regulator</li>
    <li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li>
    <li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li>
    <li>A carbonator bottle cap</li>
    <li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li>
</ul>

<p>As of August 19th 2021, we have gotten rid of the large tank, because it is too big to carry. We're looking for a tank half that size that we can re-fill.</p>
