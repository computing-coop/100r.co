<p>Foods that require 60 minutes on the stovetop will take 10-15 minutes in a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers are airtight containers, designed to allow pressure to build-up beyond atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>We cook entire meals at once, for example weâ€™ll place ingredients for chili in the bottom of the pot, with a trivet overtop with a covered bowl of rice and water. The whole meal is ready in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Pressure cookers are generally quite big, and double as a big pot(we use ours to boil corn).</p>
