<h2>Story</h2>

<p>It was first released on iOS years ago. It then became <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/alphavetist.html' target='_blank'>Alphavetist</a> when we introduced more languages, like Hebrew, Cyrillic, Korean, Inuktitut, Greek and Morse.</p>

<p>The project was a trial to see if we could design, write and assemble a project entirely within the {Uxn} computer. We also made it to practice using {Nasu}, our spritesheet editor.</p>
