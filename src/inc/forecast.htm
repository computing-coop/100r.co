<p>Our favourite weather service is <a href='http://windy.com' target='_blank'>Windy</a>, and while underway, we download weather maps({grib files}) through the <a href='http://saildocs.com' target='_blank'>saildocs</a> service with our {satellite phone} which we then process with <a href='http://predictwind.com' target='_blank'>PredictWind</a>. We pick our weather carefully on passage, no sense in taking unnecessary risks. Sailing with a {schedule} is dangerous.</p>

<p>For information on storms brewing in the Pacific and Atlantic, as well as passage advice in the South Pacific, we enjoy reading <a href='https://metbob.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>MetBob</a>.</p>
