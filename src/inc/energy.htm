<p>We have 2 {solar} panels(1x90W + 1x100W). For additional {power}, we carry a small portable gas generator as a backup to our solar. Our Hondaâ€™s 1,000W generator is compact, fuel-efficient, lightweight, and can run for 7.1 hours on 2.7 L (0.7 US Gal) of gas. Our engine has a 75 AMP Balmar alternator, but it is only used to charge the house and starter batteries on cloudy days. We consider these options as backups, as redundancy to our main source of power: solar.</p>

<p>We have a total of 464 Ah. Our flooded-cell battery banks consist of a series configured starter bank (2x6 Volt Cells) and a series-parallel configured house bank (2x6 V cells). Both sets are identical, equalling 12 V each. Because they're identical, we often use both as house banks. If this is your planned usage, keep in mind that using both banks will mean that they will degrade together, and if they fail you'll be left with no power of any kind. This is a big risk to take. We would like to change this in the future, but because we don't have space for an additional house bank we have decided that this is the best option. We keep an eye on our batteries, to make sure to replace them before they fail.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't have a windlass, pressure faucet, water heater or a fridge (see {refrigeration}). Because of this, it's easy to keep our power consumption low, reducing our need for extra solar, keeping our costs down and reducing the amount of things that can break, or fail.</p>
