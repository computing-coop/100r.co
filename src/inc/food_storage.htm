<p>We like to use glass to store food, especially big glass carboys. Plastic bins designed for drinking {water} are also good to store large quantities of grains and other dried goods, like legumes and rice. Food-grade plastics are identified by the recycling number on the bottom. 1, 2, 4 and 5 are food-grade, but also to check to see if they are “food-safe”. Food-grade plastics are very stable and won’t degrade in sunlight, but they may have been treated with a dye that compromises the bucket and could leach into your stored food or water.</p>

<p>We also carry 4 L jars for other items, as well as 1 L ones. We also use 1 gallons carboys to store grains.</p>

<p>Foods that might attract weevils include: flours, cereal, rice, quinoa, pasta, oats, barley, corn and wheat berries. Store in air-tight glass or thick-walled containers so that if there is an infestation in one jar, the insects won't be able to escape to contaminate other containers. See our notes on {provisioning}.</p>
