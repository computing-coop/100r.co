<p>In November, we sailed to the Marshall Islands. The sail from {Fiji} took us 24 days. We spent many days becalmed, without wind—typical of an area of converging tradewinds. The ITCZ is strong here.</p>

<p>We aimed straight for Majuro, and stayed there for a few months before skipping to {Japan}. Our original plan was to stop in Micronesia (Kosrae) and Guam, but because of dinghy issues we skipped them—also, we were terribly eager to arrive to Chichijima.</p>
